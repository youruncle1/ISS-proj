# ISS Project: Synthetic Piano Sound Generation

**Course:** Signal and Systems (ISS)  
**Language:** Python - jupyter notebook

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to create a synthetic piano by analyzing recorded tones and generating new ones based on a compressed set of parameters. The project included analysis, synthesis, and music generation tasks.

### Tasks and Scoring
1. **Basics** - Extracted and analyzed 0.5-second segments from stable portions of tones. (2 points)
2. **Fundamental Frequency Estimation** - Calculated the fundamental frequency of tones using methods like DFT and autocorrelation. (3 points)
3. **Frequency Refinement** - Refined frequency estimates with DTFT. (3 points)
4. **Piano Representation** - Represented each tone using 10 floating-point values by approximating a Fourier series. (3 points)
5. **Tone Synthesis** - Synthesized tones based on calculated parameters and compared with original recordings. (3 points)
6. **Music Generation** - Generated a polyphonic music track from a MIDI-based score with different sampling rates. (3 points)
7. **Spectrogram Analysis** - Generated spectrograms for the first 10 seconds of synthesized music. (1 point)

**Score:** 17/18
